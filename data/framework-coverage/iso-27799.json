    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of ISO 27799:2016 — Health informatics: Information security management in health using ISO/IEC 27002. ISO 27799 provides health-sector-specific implementation guidance for ISO/IEC 27002 controls, with additional considerations for personal health information (PHI) protection, clinical system availability, patient safety, and health data sharing. Since ISO 27799 builds on ISO 27002 which has well-established mappings to SP 800-53, coverage is naturally high for information security controls. However, ISO 27799 adds health-specific guidance on clinical workflow integration, health information exchange, and patient consent that extends beyond SP 800-53 scope. Validate with qualified health information security assessors for compliance use."

SP 800-53 provides the technical access and privacy controls but does not address research ethics integration, genomic data-specific risks, or clinical trial regulatory requirements."
