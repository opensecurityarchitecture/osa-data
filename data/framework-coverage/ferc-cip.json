The FERC-directed implementation timeline (high-impact BES Cyber Systems by 2027, medium-impact by 2030) and the phased compliance approach are regulatory directives not captured in SP 800-53. The order reflects lessons learned from sophisticated ICS-targeting threats (CRASHOVERRIDE, TRITON, Pipedream) that perform lateral movement within OT networks.
