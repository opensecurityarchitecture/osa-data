We just published the first new Open Security Architecture pattern in over a decade. It's about AI.

SP-027 Secure AI Integration is a practical security architecture for deploying AI agents in the enterprise -- from chat assistants to autonomous multi-agent swarms.

It maps 47 NIST 800-53 controls to 12 AI-specific threats including prompt injection, credential exposure in context windows, delegation chain exploitation, and shadow AI.

The part I'm most proud of: this pattern was written collaboratively between a human security architect and an AI agent with shell, file system, and git access -- using the controls described in the pattern itself. We practised what we documented.

Four deployment models, escalating controls:
1. Chat-only (data classification, prompt security)
2. Tool-augmented agents (authorisation, audit)
3. Orchestrated multi-agent (delegation trust)
4. Autonomous swarms (full control set)

Most orgs are between 1 and 2 today. The pattern helps you govern what you have now and prepare for what's coming.
