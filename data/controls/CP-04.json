  "description": "The organization: (i) tests and/or exercises the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests and/or exercises] to determine the plan’s effectiveness and the organization’s readiness to execute the plan; and (ii) reviews the contingency plan test/exercise results and initiates corrective actions.",
  "supplemental_guidance": "There are several methods for testing and/or exercising contingency plans to identify potential weaknesses (e.g., full-scale contingency plan testing, functional/tabletop exercises). The depth and rigor of contingency plan testing and/or exercises increases with the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system. Contingency plan testing and/or exercises also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and assets (e.g., reduction in mission capability) and individuals arising due to contingency operations in accordance with the plan. NIST Special Publication 800-84 provides guidance on test, training, and exercise programs for information technology plans and capabilities.",
