Rules for checking the valid syntax of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. The extent to which the information system is able to check the accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of information is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.",
