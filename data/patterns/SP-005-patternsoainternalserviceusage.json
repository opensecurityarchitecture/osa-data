    "typicalChallenges": "</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to adherance to service level agreement for a single service, end-to-end QoS management is critical for composite services. The dynamic nature of web services makes end-to-end QoS management a major challenge</li>\n<li>Performance of transaction authorization: cost of security per transaction is considerable, this will drive coarse grained services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>",
