Level 3 applies to government systems, financial institutions, healthcare, energy, and critical infrastructure in China. Extension requirements for cloud computing (8.2), mobile internet (8.3), IoT (8.4), and industrial control systems (8.5) are included as aggregate clauses. MLPS has China-specific requirements including mandatory use of nationally-approved cryptographic algorithms (SM2/SM3/SM4), trusted computing verification (TCM), government filing (备案) with public security authorities, and data sovereignty mandates that have no SP 800-53 equivalent. Validate with qualified MLPS assessors (等级测评机构) for compliance use."
