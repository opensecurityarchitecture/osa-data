Covers cyber-relevant Principles 2, 3, 15, 17, and 22 plus the eight components of the 2016 Cyber Guidance. PFMI is a principles-based framework for systemically important payment systems, CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and trade repositories. FMI-specific requirements around 2-hour recovery objectives, systemic risk management, participant default procedures, settlement finality, cross-border coordination, and capital/liquidity adequacy extend beyond SP 800-53 scope. Validate with qualified assessors for compliance/audit use."

PM-08 critical infrastructure plan establishes FMI-level resilience context.",
      "gaps": "The Cyber Guidance imposes the 2-hour Recovery Time Objective (2h-RTO) for critical operations and requires end-of-day settlement completion even after a cyber attack. SP 800-53 CP controls support recovery planning but do not mandate specific timeframes. Additional gaps: no requirement for safe resumption processes that ensure data integrity and settlement finality after a cyber compromise, no participant notification protocols during cyber incidents, no FMI-specific crisis communication with regulators and linked FMIs, no requirements for managing systemic risk during recovery (e.g., queuing, netting, unwinding decisions), and no specific guidance on resumption decisions when transaction integrity is uncertain."
