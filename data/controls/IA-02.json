  "supplemental_guidance": "Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance security control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication including strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is specified, authentication for both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63 compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the IA-2 control and its enhancements. Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for public access to such information and information systems with the need to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.
