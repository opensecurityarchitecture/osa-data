  "supplemental_guidance": "Portable and mobile devices (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, and other computing and communications devices with network connectivity and the capability of periodically operating in different physical locations) are only allowed access to organizational information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Security policies and procedures include device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), configuration management, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Protecting information residing on portable and mobile devices (e.g., employing cryptographic mechanisms to provide confidentiality and integrity protections during storage and while in transit when outside of controlled areas) is covered in the media protection family. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.\\n",
