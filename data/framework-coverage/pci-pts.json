PCI PTS focuses on physical and logical security of point-of-interaction payment devices (PIN entry, unattended terminals, mobile). Device-specific tamper resistance, hardware security module requirements, and vendor qualification processes have limited SP 800-53 equivalence. Validate with qualified PTS assessors for device certification use."

SP 800-53 covers developer screening (SA-21) and external personnel (PS-07) but does not address PCI-specific vendor qualification programs, lab evaluation processes, or payment-industry certification of development environments.
