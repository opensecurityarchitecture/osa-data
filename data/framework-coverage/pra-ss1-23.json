    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of PRA Supervisory Statement SS1/23 (Model risk management principles for banks), published May 2023 with compliance deadline May 2024. SS1/23 addresses model governance, validation, and lifecycle management for models used in risk, pricing, reserving, and capital calculations at UK-incorporated banks, building societies, and PRA-designated investment firms with internal model approval. SP 800-53 provides information security controls that support model infrastructure security but does not address model validation methodology, model performance monitoring, actuarial/quantitative model governance, or statistical soundness assessment. Coverage reflects overlap between model risk management IT infrastructure requirements and SP 800-53 control families, not model validation equivalence. Validate with PRA-regulated firm model risk management teams for compliance use."
