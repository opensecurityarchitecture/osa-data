NYDFS 500.19 provides specific exemptions for: (a) entities with fewer than 20 employees/contractors, under $7.5M gross annual revenue, or under $15M total year-end assets (limited exemption from certain sections); (b) entities that do not operate, maintain, or control information systems and have no nonpublic information (full exemption); (c) entities under Insurance Law captive insurance provisions; (d) entities that do not control nonpublic information other than employee information. These size-based and scope-based exemption thresholds are entirely NYDFS regulatory constructs with no SP 800-53 equivalent. SP 800-53 uses impact-level tailoring rather than entity-size exemptions."
