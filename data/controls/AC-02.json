  "supplemental_guidance": "Account management includes the identification of account types (i.e., individual, group, and system), establishment of conditions for group membership, and assignment of associated authorizations. The organization identifies authorized users of the information system and specifies access rights/privileges. The organization grants access to the information system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria; and (ii) intended system usage. The organization requires proper identification for requests to establish information system accounts and approves all such requests. The organization specifically authorizes and monitors the use of guest/anonymous accounts and removes, disables, or otherwise secures unnecessary accounts. Account managers are notified when information system users are terminated or transferred and associated accounts are removed, disabled, or otherwise secured. Account managers are also notified when users information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes.",
