      "AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript with XML) is a mechanism for exchanging data between browser and server without refreshing the page",
      "RSS(Really simple syndication) allows publication and subscription to frequently changing content",
      "JSON(Javascript Object Notation) is a lightweight method to pass serialised data when using Javascript and provides an alternative to XML",
      "Flash/Flex/Air/Silverlight/Gears are Client side programming and runtime execution environments that provide a richer browser experience",
      "SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a method for remote proceedure calls using XML over http",
      "REST(Representational State Transfer) is a simple architectural style that transfers state information via http resource requests."

    "assumptions": "Cloud computing is an evolving area and it is expected that this pattern will be revised within a year to reflect developments. It is likely that for large corporates a prudent and realistic strategy will be to deploy for test and development environments, which give some benefits without the downside of exposing production data sets.<br/><br/>",
    "typicalChallenges": "Trustworthiness of partner-how to establish and track? Lack of certainty on many aspects of controls required. Compliance. Ability to move to other providers. Authentication and authorization across multiple providers and systems.<br/><br/>",
    "indications": "Organization who will provide some or all of their computing environment via cloud services. Organization has constraints on existing power or space, desire to reduce capital expenditure, need to provision services rapidly, big variations in computing demand, collaboration with wide range of B2B partners.<br/><br/>",
    "contraIndications": "Lack of understanding of your compliance needs or inability to confirm how the supplier will meet your requirements.<br/><br/>",
    "threatResistance": "Untrustworthy supplier, eavesdropping, impersonation, data theft, lack of performance and logical and physical disasters are addressed by this pattern. Consider checking supplier applications for Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks which can be used to log keystrokes and capture data, and propagate web application worms such as Samy. Feed injection for RSS and Atom can allow an attacker to compromise applications, if feeds are not properly secured.<br/><br/>"
