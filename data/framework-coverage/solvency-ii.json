Solvency II is primarily a prudential capital adequacy regime for (re)insurance undertakings; its IT/cybersecurity requirements are embedded within the Pillar 2 system of governance and operational risk provisions rather than as standalone ICT regulation. Coverage percentages reflect SP 800-53 alignment with the cybersecurity and IT operational risk dimensions only — actuarial, capital, and prudential requirements are excluded as outside SP 800-53 scope. Validate with qualified assessors and national competent authorities for compliance/audit use."
