  "supplemental_guidance": "The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the organization’s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. While integrity and availability are the primary concerns for system backup information, protecting backup information from unauthorized disclosure is also an important consideration depending on the type of information residing on the backup media and the FIPS 199 impact level. An organizational assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for backup information. The protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control.
