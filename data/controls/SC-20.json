A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service; digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts; and DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure domain name system deployment.\\n",
