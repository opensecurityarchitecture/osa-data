    "disclaimer": "Based on publicly available crosswalks and expert analysis. DNB Good Practice Information Security is a Dutch financial sector framework issued by De Nederlandsche Bank for supervised institutions including banks, insurers, and pension funds. Structured around a COBIT 4.1 maturity model with 7 elements, 22 themes, and 58 controls. DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) now supersedes DNB Good Practice for in-scope financial entities as of January 2025, but DNB Good Practice continues to apply for pension funds and other entities not yet within DORA scope. The proportionality principle applies — institutions should implement controls proportionate to their size, complexity, and risk profile. Validate with qualified assessors for compliance/audit use."
