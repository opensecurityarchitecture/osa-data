  "supplemental_guidance": "This control enables remote clients to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the name/address resolution information obtained through the service. A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service; digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts; and DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure domain name system deployment.",
