    "assumptions": "This pattern assumes that primary defensive layers have failed, and a malicious attacker has entered the environment and established an initial foothold.</p>\n<p>",
    "typicalChallenges": "This pattern leverages many common controls, however it requires a considerable increase in operational maturity to reach each of the target control objectives outlined in the CSIS Critical Controls for Effective Cyber Defense.<br/><br/>",
    "indications": "You should apply this pattern if you believe you organisation may be likely target of a sophisticated blended attack charateristic of Advanced Persistent Threats.<br/><br/>",
    "contraIndications": "You should not attempt to implement all elements of this pattern unless your organisation has high operational maturity with respect to change and configuration management. Key detective controls in this pattern are dependent on accurate configuration management data.<br/><br/>",
    "threatResistance": "This pattern can assist in limiting the spread and impact of an advanced breach through early detection and response.<br/><br/>"
