System use notification messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log in to the information system. For publicly accessible systems: (i) the system use information is available and when appropriate, is displayed before granting access; (ii) any references to monitoring, recording, or auditing are in keeping with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and (iii) the notice given to public users of the information system includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.\\n",
