    "assumptions": "The WSDL interface (registry entry) of a web-service can be considered an (implicit) contract between the service provider and the service consumer. The ebXML suite of standards has some support for security properties. <br/><br/>",
    "typicalChallenges": "There are no standards/guidelines that would help to enforce the (implicit) contract. On the market there is some tooling around that help to write policies for contract enforcement/negotiation and then act like a service guard. <br/><br/>",
    "indications": "Whenever you can distinguish between trustworthy callers and less trusted callers. Trustworthiness typically is certified by those that operate or own the provided services.<br/><br/>",
    "contraIndications": "You do not need to implement registry protection if you trust all the potential callers.<br/><br/>",
    "threatResistance": "Threat agents: Rogue employees, rogue developers, rogue suppliers<br/><br/>"
