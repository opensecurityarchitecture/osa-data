  "description": "The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.",
  "supplemental_guidance": "Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or information systems, occur through managed interfaces consisting of appropriate boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels) arranged in an effective architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). Information system boundary protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as that of the primary site. As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher- impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and applying the concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include third party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-77 provides guidance on virtual private networks. Related security controls: MP- 4, RA-02.",
