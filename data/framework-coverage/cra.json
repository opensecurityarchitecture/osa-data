    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (Cyber Resilience Act) against SP 800-53 Rev 5. The CRA is an EU product security regulation applying to manufacturers, importers, and distributors of products with digital elements. Annex I essential requirements are legally binding with penalties up to EUR 15 million or 2.5% of worldwide annual turnover. CRA complements NIS2 (which targets operators/essential entities) by addressing the product supply side. Full applicability from 11 December 2027, with vulnerability reporting obligations from 11 September 2026. Security-update obligation extends for the support period (minimum 5 years from placing on market). CRA is product-focused (manufacturer obligations) while NIST 800-53 is organisation/system-focused, meaning some CRA requirements around vulnerability disclosure, SBOM, incident reporting to ENISA, and CE marking conformity have only partial NIST coverage. Validate with qualified assessors for compliance/audit use."
