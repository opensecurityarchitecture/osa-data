    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of HITRUST CSF v11. HITRUST CSF is a comprehensive framework that integrates requirements from HIPAA, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001/27002, COBIT, PCI DSS, and other standards into a unified control framework for health information. Since HITRUST CSF explicitly incorporates SP 800-53 controls as one of its authoritative sources, coverage is naturally high. However, HITRUST adds implementation maturity scoring (PRISMA-based), alternative controls, scoping factors, and certification assessment methodology that extend beyond SP 800-53 scope. Validate with HITRUST-authorised external assessors for certification use."
