  "supplemental_guidance": "An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media requiring labeling. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring labeling and the specific measures taken to afford such protection. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the media. For example, labeling is not required for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.\\n",
