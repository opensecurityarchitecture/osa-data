IAEA NSS provides international guidance for nuclear facility computer security with specific requirements for safety-critical I&C systems, physical protection integration, and nuclear material security not captured in SP 800-53. Nuclear facility cybersecurity requires integration with safety analysis, regulatory licensing, and physical protection programs. Validate with nuclear security professionals and national regulatory authorities for compliance use."

Unidirectional gateways (data diodes) between levels -- particularly between safety and non-safety zones -- are a fundamental nuclear requirement not specifically addressed by SP 800-53 boundary controls. Deterministic I&C isolation requirements, nuclear safety system air-gap mandates, and the prohibition of bidirectional communication paths to safety-critical networks exceed the logical separation concepts in SP 800-53."

Safety system configuration control demands QA-grade oversight with documented basis for every setting. Vendor-qualified patches -- where I&C system vendors must certify patch compatibility with real-time safety system operation -- represent a domain-specific supply chain constraint. Anti-malware compatibility with real-time I&C systems is a significant challenge, as signature updates and scanning activities must not interfere with deterministic safety function execution."
