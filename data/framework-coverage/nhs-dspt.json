The DSPT is a mandatory self-assessment for all organisations that have access to NHS patient data and systems. SP 800-53 provides comprehensive security controls that address many DSPT assertions, but does not address NHS-specific requirements such as Caldicott Guardian appointment, NHS mail/network connectivity standards, NHS Digital registration, Data Protection Impact Assessments under UK GDPR, or NHS-specific data sharing agreements. Coverage reflects overlap between DSPT security assertions and SP 800-53 control families. Validate with NHS Digital/NHS England and qualified Data Protection Officers for compliance use."
