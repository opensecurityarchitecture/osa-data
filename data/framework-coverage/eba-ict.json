Incorporates new SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls where they genuinely improve coverage. The EBA ICT Guidelines have EU-specific supervisory expectations, PSD2 payment service linkages, and outsourcing provisions that extend beyond SP 800-53 scope. DORA supersedes most sections from January 2025, but the guidelines remain widely referenced as interpretive basis. Validate with qualified assessors for compliance/audit use."
