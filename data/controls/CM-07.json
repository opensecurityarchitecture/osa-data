  "supplemental_guidance": "Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, the organization limits component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, File Transfer Protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, file sharing).\\n",
