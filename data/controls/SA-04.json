  "description": "The organization includes security requirements and/or security specifications, either explicitly or by reference, in information system acquisition contracts based on an assessment of risk and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.",
  "supplemental_guidance": "(1) Solicitation Documents; The solicitation documents (e.g., Requests for Proposals) for information systems and services include, either explicitly or by reference, security requirements that describe: (i) required security capabilities (security needs and, as necessary, specific security controls and other specific FISMA requirements); (ii) required design and development processes; (iii) required test and evaluation procedures; and (iv) required documentation. The requirements in the solicitation documents permit updating security controls as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented. NIST Special Publication 800-36 provides guidance on the selection of information security products. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on security considerations in the system development life cycle. (2) Information System Documentation; The solicitation documents include requirements for appropriate information system documentation. The documentation addresses user and systems administrator guidance and information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information system. The level of detail required in the documentation is based on the FIPS 199 security category for the information system. (3) Use of Tested, Evaluated, and Validated Products; NIST Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on the acquisition and use of tested/evaluated information technology products. (4) Configuration Settings and Implementation Guidance; The information system required documentation includes security configuration settings and security implementation guidance. OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for federal information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-70 provides guidance on configuration settings for information technology products.",
