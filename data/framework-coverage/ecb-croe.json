The CROE operationalises the CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on Cyber Resilience for FMIs (June 2016) for the euro area. Structured around five risk management categories (governance, identification, protection, detection, response/recovery) and three overarching components (testing, situational awareness, learning/evolving) with three maturity levels (evolving, advancing, innovating). ECB-specific requirements include TIBER-EU threat intelligence-led red teaming, 2-hour RTO for critical FMI operations, euro area systemic risk considerations, ECB oversight reporting, cross-border FMI coordination, and DORA alignment. Validate with qualified assessors for compliance/audit use."
