SS1/21 establishes requirements for identifying important business services, setting impact tolerances, mapping resources, scenario testing, and self-assessment. SS2/21 establishes requirements for outsourcing governance, materiality assessment, due diligence, contractual arrangements, sub-outsourcing, intra-group outsourcing, and exit strategies. SP 800-53 provides information security controls that support operational resilience infrastructure but does not address UK-specific regulatory concepts such as important business service methodology, impact tolerance setting, or PRA outsourcing materiality assessment. Validate with PRA-regulated firm operational resilience teams for compliance use."
