    "disclaimer": "Based on IEEE 1686-2022 Standard for Intelligent Electronic Devices Cyber Security Capabilities and expert analysis mapping to SP 800-53 Rev 5. IEEE 1686 defines product-level security capabilities for substation IEDs (protective relays, bay controllers) that are vendor-implemented features rather than operational security controls. SP 800-53 addresses organizational security controls, creating an inherent scope gap with product capability standards. Validate with power systems security engineers for procurement and compliance use."
