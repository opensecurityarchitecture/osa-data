Common Criteria defines an evaluation framework for IT security products through Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) at Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL 1-7). While SFR classes (audit, cryptography, access control, identification) align conceptually with SP 800-53 control families, the evaluation methodology, Protection Profile conformance, and mutual recognition processes have no SP 800-53 equivalence. Coverage reflects conceptual security alignment, not evaluation equivalence. Validate with Common Criteria Testing Laboratories (CCTL) for product evaluation and certification use."
