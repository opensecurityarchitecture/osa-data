  "supplemental_guidance": "External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the accreditation boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to, personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal digital assistants); privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct control of the organization. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system. This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access organizational information systems and information that are intended for public access (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through public interfaces to organizational information systems). The organization establishes terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of applications that can be accessed on the organizational information system from the external information system; and (ii) the maximum FIPS 199 security category of information that can be processed, stored, and transmitted on the external information system.\\n",
  "enhancements": "(1) The organization prohibits authorized individuals from using an external information system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information except in situations where the organization: (i) can verify the employment of required security controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s information security policy and system security plan; or (ii) has approved information system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.\\n",
