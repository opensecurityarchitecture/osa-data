EPA coordination requirements mandate that ERPs be certified to the EPA Administrator within 6 months of completing the risk assessment. State primacy agency notification procedures, coordination with local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), and integration with community-wide emergency response plans are sector-specific obligations.

Many water utilities are governed by elected boards, municipal councils, or special district commissions with limited cybersecurity expertise. Small utility resource constraints (utilities serving 3,300-10,000 people often have fewer than 10 total staff) make dedicated cybersecurity roles impractical. Integration with Safe Drinking Water Act compliance programs, state drinking water program requirements, and EPA oversight mechanisms are sector-specific governance requirements. The AWWA guidance emphasizes risk management approaches scaled to utility size and resources, which is not addressed by SP 800-53's enterprise-focused governance model."

Legacy systems are extremely common in the water sector with many utilities operating PLCs and RTUs that are 15-25 years old with no vendor support. The asset management challenge extends to distributed physical infrastructure (pump stations, elevated storage tanks, well houses, distribution valve vaults) connected via cellular modems, licensed radio, or leased lines that must be inventoried and secured."

      "gaps": "Water utility access control faces unique challenges not addressed by SP 800-53 including remote pump stations and well houses that may be unmanned and located in rural areas requiring both physical and electronic access controls with limited connectivity. Emergency access during water main breaks, treatment upsets, or natural disasters requires rapid operator access that may conflict with strict authentication requirements. Shared credentials on legacy SCADA systems (many older HMI workstations support only a single shared login) are common and difficult to remediate without full system replacement. Seasonal and part-time operators, common in small utilities, complicate personnel access management."

      "gaps": "Water utility networks face unique challenges including highly distributed sites (pump stations, tanks, well houses) connected via cellular modems, licensed radio frequencies, or leased telephone lines with limited bandwidth insufficient for enterprise-grade security monitoring. SCADA communication protocols such as Modbus TCP/RTU, DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol 3), and OPC UA lack native security features and require protocol-aware firewalls or gateways for protection. Small utility resource constraints limit the ability to deploy and maintain network segmentation, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Many water utilities share network infrastructure with municipal IT departments, complicating segmentation and security responsibility boundaries."

EPA Water Security Division guidance recommends integration of process control monitoring with cybersecurity monitoring to detect attacks that manipulate physical processes. Limited SOC (Security Operations Center) capability in small and medium utilities means most water systems lack 24/7 monitoring capability and rely on SCADA alarm callout systems designed for process alarms rather than security events."

Public health notification requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act may be triggered by cyber incidents that affect treatment processes or water quality. Treatment process recovery procedures after a cyber incident (verifying chemical dosing rates, flushing contaminated water, restarting treatment processes in correct sequence) require specialized water treatment expertise beyond typical IT incident response. Coordination with public health departments for potential contamination events and issuing public advisories (boil water notices, do-not-use orders) are sector-specific incident response obligations."

Long-term vendor relationships spanning decades are common as water utilities maintain SCADA systems for 15-25 years with the same integrator. Municipal procurement requirements (competitive bidding, lowest responsible bidder rules) may conflict with security-driven vendor selection. Limited vendor security assessment capability in small utilities means most water systems accept vendor default configurations. System integrator access to SCADA systems during commissioning, maintenance, and troubleshooting creates persistent third-party access that is difficult to monitor."

Limited cyber expertise among water operators whose primary training and certification is in water treatment and distribution operations, not information technology. Cross-functional operators who must manage both physical processes and digital systems create unique insider risk profiles. WaterISAC training resources and EPA cybersecurity guidance provide sector-specific training content not available through general security awareness programs. State certification requirements for water operators focus on treatment and distribution competency with emerging but limited cybersecurity components."
