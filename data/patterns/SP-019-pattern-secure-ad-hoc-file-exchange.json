    "assumptions": "As it has to be assumed that the data that is shared can be classified as confidential, strong encryption is required by most corporate security policies. Data on the move as well as data at rest should therefore be encrypted, and access control policies probably declare the “Need to know principal”. In an ad-hoc scenario it is unlikely that digital rights management solutions (with water marking, and copy prevention) would be required. However integrity assurance on a technical level (for example with hash-value comparison before and after transmission) can be added.<br/><br/>",
    "typicalChallenges": "",
    "indications": "The discussed pattern matches best if the following indicators can be found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business driven: business decides ad-hoc when and where the solution is required/used</li>\n<li>Simplified user interface, allows also staff members with low IT affinity to use the solution</li>\n<li>Low integration costs</li>\n<li>Identity federation with partner is not established</li>\n<li>Business unit is data owner, IT does not act as data owner custodian, business unit staff members can decide who needs access, when and where</li>\n<li>Audit trail needs to be available</li>\n<li>Strong authentication for example with second authentication factor (after uid/pw) that is transmitted over SMS is likely to be required for sensitive data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/><br/>",
    "contraIndications": "Strong integration into document management workflow requires a single repository for internal and external collaboration. Real-time collaboration requirements would suggest a solution that includes collaborative editing and in-band update notification. <br/><br/>",
