Incorporates new SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls where they genuinely improve coverage. LGPD is a data protection law with significant legal/privacy obligations outside SP 800-53 scope. BCB Resolution 4893 contains financial-sector-specific cybersecurity requirements for institutions regulated by the Banco Central do Brasil. Expect low coverage for LGPD legal-basis articles and BCB regulatory-reporting clauses. Validate with qualified Brazilian data protection and financial regulation professionals for compliance/audit use."
