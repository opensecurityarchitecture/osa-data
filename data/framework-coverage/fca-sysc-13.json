    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of FCA Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) Chapter 13 \u2014 Operational risk: systems and controls. SYSC 13 establishes high-level, principles-based requirements for operational risk management in FCA-authorised firms, providing guidance on interpreting SYSC 3.1.1R and SYSC 3.2.6R. SP 800-53 provides detailed technical controls that support operational risk management for IT systems but does not address broader operational risk categories (people risk, legal risk, regulatory risk) or FCA-specific conduct requirements including the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR). Coverage reflects overlap between IT operational risk requirements and SP 800-53 control families. Validate with FCA-regulated firm compliance teams for regulatory use."
