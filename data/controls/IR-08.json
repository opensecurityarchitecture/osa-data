Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability; 3. Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization; 4. Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions; 5. Defines reportable incidents; 6. Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization; 7.

Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 10. Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to [Assignment: organization-defined entities, personnel, or roles]; b. Distribute copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; c. Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing; d.
