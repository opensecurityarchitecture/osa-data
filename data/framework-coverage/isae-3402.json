    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of ISAE 3402 (Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organisation). ISAE 3402 is an assurance engagement standard defining how service auditors assess and report on controls at service organisations relevant to user entities' financial reporting. SP 800-53 addresses the security controls that may form part of an ISAE 3402 control environment, but not the audit methodology, sampling procedures, management assertions, Type I/II evidence requirements, or complementary user entity controls (CUECs) that constitute the assurance framework. Coverage reflects overlap between ISAE 3402 control objectives and SP 800-53 control families, not assurance equivalence. Validate with qualified service auditors for ISAE 3402 reporting use."
