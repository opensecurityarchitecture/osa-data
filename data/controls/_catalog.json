      "supplemental_guidance": "Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance security control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication including strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is specified, authentication for both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63 compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the IA-2 control and its enhancements. Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for public access to such information and information systems with the need to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.

A few, of many, generalized examples of possible restrictions that are better expressed as flow control than access control are: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet filtering capability.

      "supplemental_guidance": "An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the accreditation boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization’s operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified instance of non-compliance.

Information system boundary protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as that of the primary site. As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher- impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and applying the concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include third party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk.

To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). If organizational information technology resources are divided into those resources belonging to internal networks and those resources belonging to external networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are established. The DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information pertaining to both internal and external information technology resources while the DNS server with the external role only provides name/address resolution information pertaining to external information technology resources. The list of clients who can access the authoritative DNS server of a particular role is also specified. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure DNS deployment.\\n",

The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security certification and accreditation process. To satisfy the annual FISMA assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security certifications conducted as part of an information system accreditation or reaccreditation process (see CA-4); (ii) continuous monitoring activities (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle process (provided that the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness). Existing security assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment information is critical in achieving a broad-based, cost-effective, and fully integrated security program capable of producing the needed evidence to determine the actual security status of the information system.

The authorizing official decides on the required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity of the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be achieved by ensuring the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results.

The organization can use the current year’s assessment results obtained during continuous monitoring to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2). This control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in monitoring configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the information system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones—the three principle documents in the security accreditation package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the level of effort required for the reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the continuous monitoring process. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment of security controls. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.\\n",
