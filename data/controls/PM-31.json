Establishing the following organization-wide metrics to be monitored: [Assignment: organization-defined metrics]; b. Establishing [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessment of control effectiveness; c. Ongoing monitoring of organizationally-defined metrics in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy; d. Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments and monitoring; e. Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring information; and f. Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].",
  "supplemental_guidance": "Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness of the security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions.
