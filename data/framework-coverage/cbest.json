    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of the CBEST threat intelligence-led penetration testing framework. CBEST is a methodology framework prescribing how to conduct intelligence-led penetration tests of UK financial infrastructure, not a set of security controls. SP 800-53 addresses penetration testing (CA-08) and vulnerability assessment (RA-05) but not the detailed threat intelligence gathering, red team tradecraft, provider accreditation, or regulatory coordination processes that define CBEST. Coverage reflects conceptual alignment rather than direct control equivalence. Validate with CBEST-accredited threat intelligence and penetration testing providers for regulatory compliance."

CM-08 system component inventory and CM-12 (Rev 5) information location support identification of in-scope systems and data flows.",
      "gaps": "CBEST scoping is driven by threat intelligence rather than generic risk assessment. Gaps include: identification of critical functions as defined by PRA/FCA operational resilience requirements (not generic FIPS 199 categorisation), scenario-based targeting where the penetration test scope is derived from the Threat Intelligence Report's attack scenarios, regulatory agreement on scope with the PRA/FCA before testing commences, exclusion management specific to live financial infrastructure (settlement systems, payment rails, market operations), and iterative scope refinement during the engagement based on intelligence findings.

Gaps include: controlled multi-vector attack simulation replicating real adversary TTPs across network, application, social engineering, and physical vectors, stealth and evasion techniques that test the organisation's detection capabilities without triggering premature discovery, campaign management spanning weeks or months mimicking advanced persistent threat (APT) lifecycle, use of custom tooling and tradecraft calibrated to the threat intelligence scenarios, real-time coordination with the white team to manage safety and risk during live testing of financial infrastructure, command and control (C2) infrastructure setup and management, and lateral movement and privilege escalation within production environments.

Gaps include: measurement of detection time (mean time to detect) against specific adversary techniques, assessment of SOC analyst capability to identify and escalate sophisticated attack activity, evaluation of detection coverage gaps against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques employed by the red team, analysis of alert fidelity and false positive rates under adversary simulation conditions, assessment of the blue team's ability to correlate indicators across multiple detection sources during an active campaign, and evaluation of whether the blue team could have disrupted the attack at key kill chain stages.
