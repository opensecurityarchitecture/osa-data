Designated senior-level officials within the organization review and approve the security categorizations.\\n",
  "supplemental_guidance": "The applicable federal standard for security categorization of nonnational security information and information systems is FIPS 199. The organization conducts FIPS 199 security categorizations as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of the chief information officer, senior agency information security officer, information system owners, and information owners. The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system. As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher-impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and restricting or prohibiting network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides guidance on determining the security categories of the information types resident on the information system. Related security controls: MP-4, SC-7.\\n",
