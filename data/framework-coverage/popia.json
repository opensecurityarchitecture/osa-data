Existing customer exception requires: contact details obtained during a sale, marketing of similar products/services, and reasonable opportunity to opt out at each communication. Marketing communications must identify the sender and provide opt-out contact details. SP 800-53 has no controls addressing direct marketing restrictions, opt-out mechanisms, or electronic communication marketing rules. These are sector-specific regulatory requirements."

Data subjects must be given an opportunity to make representations and be provided with information about the underlying logic. SP 800-53 PT-08 is limited to US federal computer matching. POPIA Section 71 is broader — covering all automated profiling decisions — and requires explainability and the right to contest, which have no SP 800-53 equivalents."

The adequacy assessment, binding corporate rules, and contractual safeguards for international transfers are entirely legal/regulatory constructs outside SP 800-53 scope.
