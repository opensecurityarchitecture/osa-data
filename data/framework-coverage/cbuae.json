      "gaps": "CBUAE requires business impact analysis (BIA) with specific RTO/RPO targets for critical banking services (core banking, payments, treasury systems). Crisis management requirements include crisis communication plans, senior management crisis teams, and coordination with UAE national CERT (aeCERT). Resilience testing must include full disaster recovery exercises at least annually with documented results reported to the board. CBUAE mandates impact tolerance statements for important business services aligned with the broader operational resilience framework. Scenario-based resilience testing covering cyber attacks, technology failures, and third-party disruptions are CBUAE-specific requirements."

CBUAE regulatory examination preparation requires maintaining evidence repositories and designated liaison officers for supervisory inspections. Remediation plans for CBUAE examination findings must include defined timelines and board-level tracking. Compliance with UAE-specific regulations including UAE Cybercrime Law, UAE Data Protection Law, UAE Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law, and CBUAE circulars on technology risk are jurisdiction-specific obligations with no SP 800-53 equivalent. Integration with CBUAE's supervisory technology (SupTech) reporting platforms is a UAE-specific requirement."
