CMMC Level 2 aligns directly to NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 (110 security requirements across 14 domains), which itself derives from SP 800-53 moderate baseline. SP 800-53 Rev 5 provides broader and deeper coverage than CMMC requires. Gaps arise from DoD-specific CUI marking/handling, DFARS 252.204-7012 clause requirements, C3PAO assessment methodology, and SPRS scoring model which are regulatory rather than technical. Validate with qualified CMMC Registered Practitioners or C3PAOs for compliance/audit use."

      "gaps": "CMMC practice 3.13.11 (FIPS-validated cryptography) is a critical requirement with DoD-specific enforcement: all cryptographic modules must be FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated, and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) certificate must be active. SP 800-53 SC-13 references FIPS-validated cryptography but does not prescribe the DoD enforcement posture or the implications for commercial products. Practice 3.13.14 (control and monitor VoIP) was mapped to SC-19 in 800-171, but SC-19 was withdrawn in 800-53 Rev 5 — the requirement is now distributed across SC-07 and other controls. Cloud environments handling CUI must additionally meet FedRAMP Moderate baseline, creating a layered compliance requirement beyond 800-53."

      "gaps": "CMMC requires malware protection and monitoring specifically within the CUI boundary, with DoD-specific expectations for endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. The DoD increasingly expects behavioral-based detection beyond signature-based antivirus (3.14.2/3.14.4). DFARS 252.204-7012 requires the contractor to conduct a review for evidence of compromise when notified by DoD of a cyber incident, including analysis of CUI exfiltration — a response obligation not captured in SP 800-53 integrity controls."
