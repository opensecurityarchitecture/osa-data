There is access control software on the information system that prevents users from having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform fraudulent activity without collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, quality assurance/testing, configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.",
