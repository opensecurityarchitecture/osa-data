C2M2 is a voluntary maturity model designed for the energy sector with maturity indicator levels (MIL 0-3) that assess organizational capability progression rather than prescribing specific technical controls. SP 800-53 maps well to C2M2 practices but does not capture the maturity assessment methodology or energy sector-specific operational context. Validate with DOE C2M2 facilitators for self-assessment use."
