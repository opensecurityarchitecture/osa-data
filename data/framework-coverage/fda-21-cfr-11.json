Part 11 establishes criteria for acceptance of electronic records and electronic signatures by the FDA. SP 800-53 provides comprehensive information security controls that address many Part 11 technical requirements (access control, audit trails, system validation) but does not address FDA-specific concepts such as predicate rule compliance, open vs closed system distinctions, biometric/non-biometric signature requirements, or GxP validation methodology (IQ/OQ/PQ). Coverage reflects overlap between Part 11 technical controls and SP 800-53 control families, not GxP validation equivalence. Validate with qualified FDA compliance professionals for regulatory submission use."

Part 11 does not mandate hardware tokens or biometric factors as SP 800-53 MFA enhancements do — the two-component approach is specific to the regulatory context.
