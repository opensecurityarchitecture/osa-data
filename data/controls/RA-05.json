  "supplemental_guidance": "Vulnerability scanning is conducted using appropriate scanning tools and techniques. The organization trains selected personnel in the use and maintenance of vulnerability scanning tools and techniques. Vulnerability scans are scheduled and/or random in accordance with organizational policy and assessment of risk. The information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process is freely shared with appropriate personnel throughout the organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, more specialized approaches (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools for applications, source code reviews, static analysis of source code). NIST Special Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network security testing. NIST Special Publication 800-40 (Version 2) provides guidance on patch and vulnerability management.",
