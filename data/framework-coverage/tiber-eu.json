TIBER-EU is a testing methodology framework prescribing how to conduct threat intelligence-based red team tests of financial entities across the EU, not a set of security controls. SP 800-53 addresses penetration testing (CA-08) and threat assessment (RA-03) but not the detailed threat intelligence gathering, red team engagement models, cross-border mutual recognition, or regulatory coordination processes that define TIBER-EU. Coverage reflects conceptual alignment rather than direct control equivalence. Validate with TIBER-EU-accredited providers and national competent authorities for regulatory compliance."

Critical gaps include: mandatory testing on live production systems — TIBER-EU requires red team testing against the entity's actual production environment, not test or staging systems, multi-phase attack execution spanning weeks to months, simulating the full adversary kill chain from initial access through lateral movement to objective completion, accredited red team provider requirements including team qualifications, tool restrictions, and rules of engagement approved by the TCT, flag-based objectives where the red team must attempt to reach specific targets defined in the TTI phase, covert execution where the blue team and wider organisation are unaware the test is taking place, real-time risk management with abort procedures and the white team monitoring to prevent unintended operational impact, TTPs drawn from the TTI report simulating realistic adversary behaviour specific to the entity's threat profile, and mandatory documentation of every attack phase including successful and failed techniques.
