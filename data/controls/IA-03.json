  "supplemental_guidance": "The information system typically uses either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses) or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. The required strength of the device authentication mechanism is determined by the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system with higher impact levels requiring stronger authentication.",
