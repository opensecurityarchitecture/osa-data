This is not a security architecture pattern itself — it is the canonical reference that pattern authors use to ensure consistency across the catalogue. Covers the pattern JSON schema, SVG diagram anatomy, colour palette, typography, section definitions, and writing tone. Every new or revised pattern should be validated against SP-000 before publication.",

    "description": "As the OSA pattern catalogue grows beyond 40 patterns, visual and structural consistency becomes essential. SP-000 is the single source of truth for how patterns are written, structured, and presented. It defines the JSON schema that every pattern must follow, the SVG diagram conventions that make patterns instantly recognisable, and the writing style that keeps content authoritative but accessible.\n\nThis pattern is itself an example of the conventions it describes. The diagram serves as an annotated anatomy of a pattern SVG, with callouts explaining each visual element. Authors should refer to this pattern when creating new patterns or revising existing ones.\n\nSP-000 is not versioned like security patterns — it evolves as the design system matures. Changes to SP-000 should be reflected across all active patterns during the next polishing cycle.",
    "keyControlAreas": [
      "Pattern JSON Structure: Every pattern is a JSON file in data/patterns/ conforming to the pattern schema. Required fields: id (SP-NNN format), slug (kebab-case URL segment), title (concise, no abbreviations), description (2-4 sentences summarising scope and value), metadata (release, classification, status, dates, authors), diagram (SVG and PNG paths), content (description, keyControlAreas, assumptions, typicalChallenges, indications, contraIndications, threatResistance), examples (named sets with bullet points), references (title, url, note), threats (id, name, mitigatedBy), controls (id, name, family, emphasis), controlFamilySummary (family counts), relatedPatterns and relatedPatternNames (linked patterns). The description field is the most important — it appears in search results and meta tags. Write it as a single paragraph that would convince a CISO to click through.",
      "SVG Diagram Conventions: All pattern diagrams use a 960x720 viewBox with the system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif font stack. Background fill #f8fafc with rx=8 on the outer rect. The diagram is the first thing a practitioner sees — it must communicate the pattern's core architecture in a single glance. Layout typically uses 2-3 columns: zones for process/lifecycle, architecture/domains, and threats or intelligence. Every diagram must include: a title/governance bar (dark #00171F band at x=16 y=16, width=928, rx=6, with control lozenges), content sections, a NIST control band (dark bar with individual lozenges), and a legend/reference footer. Threat boxes (with severity colours) appear in patterns that have a dedicated threats column (SP-042, SP-043 style). Related pattern links appear in a separate section at the bottom.",
      "Title / Governance Bar: The top band is a dark bar: rect x=16 y=16 width=928 height=48-60 rx=6 fill=#00171F. Title text centred: uppercase, letter-spacing 2, font-size 12, font-weight 700, white. Below the title, control lozenges (dark-bar style) are placed directly on the bar with pipe separators between control families. This bar serves as the NIST governance anchor — it shows the controls that govern the entire pattern scope. Alternative style (SP-042/043): full-width gradient header from #003459 to #007EA7 with pattern ID at x=20 and title at x=100; this style is used for patterns with a dedicated threats column on the right.",
      "Section Headers: Height 26-28px, rx=6, fill #003459. Text centred, font-size 9.5-11, font-weight 600, white. Used to delineate major diagram zones and phases. Section boxes use dashed borders: stroke=#003459 stroke-width=1.5 stroke-dasharray='6 3' for zone boundaries. Active/highlighted phases may use #007EA7 stroke with stroke-width=2.",
      "Content Boxes: Two styles. (A) Zone boxes: white fill, stroke #003459 or #007EA7, stroke-width 1.5, stroke-dasharray '6 3', rx=6. Title bar within zone: fill #003459 or #007EA7, height 26-28px. (B) Item boxes: fill #003459 opacity 0.06 with stroke #003459 stroke-width 1, rx=3-4 — used for individual items within zones. Title text: font-size 9-10, font-weight 600, fill #003459 or #334155. Description text: font-size 7.5-8.5, fill #64748b. Keep text concise — diagram boxes are not the place for full explanations.",
      "Threat Boxes: Height 34px, rx=4. Three severity tiers: Critical (fill #FFF5F5, stroke #D32F2F), Moderate (fill #FFF8E1, stroke #F57C00), Lower (fill #E8F5E9, stroke #43A047). Threat ID (T-NN-NNN) in bold, font-size 9, colour matching severity. Threat name: font-size 9, fill #555. Description: font-size 8, fill #888. Show 6-8 representative threats; note total count if pattern has more.",
      "NIST Control Band and Control Lozenges: This is the canonical control badge specification — consistency here is non-negotiable. TWO VARIANTS exist. (1) Inline badges (on light backgrounds): rect width=38-44 height=14-18 rx=7-9, fill=controlColour opacity=0.12 (NO stroke). Text: fill=controlColour font-size=7-8 font-weight=600, text-anchor=middle. Standard controls use #007EA7, critical emphasis controls use #D32F2F. Always include target='_top' on the <a> tag. (2) Dark-bar badges (on #00171F background): rect width=44-48 height=16-18 rx=8-9, fill=controlColour opacity=0.35 stroke=lighterColour stroke-width=0.5. Text: fill=lighterColour. Standard: fill=#007EA7 opacity=0.35 stroke=#00A8E8, text fill=#00A8E8. Critical: fill=#D32F2F opacity=0.25 stroke=#D32F2F, text fill=#FF5252. Pipe separators '|' between control families: fill=#94a3b8 font-size=8. The NIST control band uses a dark bar (rect x=16 width=928 rx=6 fill=#00171F) containing all pattern controls as individual lozenges arranged in 1-2 rows by family. Above the dark bar, an optional header bar (fill #003459, height 28px, rx=4) shows 'NIST 800-53 Rev 5 CONTROL MAPPINGS — N Controls Across M Families'.",
      "Related Patterns and References: Light background bar (fill #007EA7 opacity 0.1, height 28px). Pattern links as boxes (white fill, stroke #00A8E8, rx=5, height 36px) showing pattern ID and short name. Key references as clickable text links (font-size 8, fill #007EA7, text-decoration underline). Maximum 8 related patterns and 5 references.",
      "Legend and Footer: The bottom of the diagram contains a legend section. Left side: pattern ID and title (font-size 10, font-weight 600, fill #334155), followed by control count, authors, status, date (font-size 9, fill #64748b). Below: line legend items showing stroke styles (solid = control flow, dashed = response), a clickable XX-00 badge example, and zone boundary sample. Right side: 'opensecurityarchitecture.org' (font-size 9, fill #94a3b8, text-anchor end). Reference links as clickable text (font-size 8-8.5, fill #007EA7). For patterns using the gradient-header style (SP-042/043), a separate footer line at y=710 format: 'SP-NNN Pattern Title — CC BY-SA 4.0 — Open Security Architecture 2026' (font-size 9, fill #999, text-anchor middle).",
      "Arrows and Connectors: Standard arrow marker: markerWidth=8, markerHeight=6, refX=7, refY=3, path 'M0 0L8 3L0 6z'. Three marker colours: #007EA7 (primary flow), #003459 (dark/governance flow), #00A8E8 (response/signal flow). Control flow: solid stroke #003459 stroke-width=1.5. Response/signal: dashed stroke #00A8E8 stroke-width=1.5 stroke-dasharray='4 3'. White lozenge technique for labels on arrows: rect fill='white' opacity='0.9' rx=3 behind text (font-size 7, font-weight 500-600). Lifecycle/feedback arrows use #00A8E8 (lighter teal).",
      "Writing Style — Pattern Descriptions: Write for a senior security practitioner (10+ years experience) who needs to decide quickly whether this pattern applies to their architecture. Lead with what the pattern does, not what it is. Use concrete examples over abstract principles. Reference specific standards (NIST, ISO, CIS) with control IDs. Avoid marketing language, buzzwords, and vague claims. One long paragraph is better than five short ones — practitioners scan, they do not read bullet points in descriptions.",
      "Writing Style — Key Control Areas: Each KCA opens with a parenthetical listing the primary NIST 800-53 controls. Body text describes what to implement, how to measure it, and what good looks like. Include specific targets where industry consensus exists (e.g. 'MTTR critical vulns: target <7 days'). End with common mistakes to avoid. Tone: authoritative, specific, actionable.",
      "Writing Style — Threats: Each threat describes a realistic failure mode, not a theoretical risk. Name the threat concisely (8 words max). Description should make a practitioner nod in recognition — 'yes, I have seen this'. Use the T-NN-NNN naming convention. Map each threat to 2-3 controls that mitigate it.",
      "Colour Palette: Background #f8fafc. Dark bars #00171F. Section headers #003459. Content stroke/zones #007EA7. Light teal #00A8E8 (signals, responses, lighter accents). Inline badge fill: #007EA7 opacity 0.12. Dark-bar badge fill: #007EA7 opacity 0.35 stroke #00A8E8. Critical emphasis: #D32F2F (inline opacity 0.12, dark-bar opacity 0.25, dark-bar text #FF5252). Threat box tiers — Critical: fill #FFF5F5 stroke #D32F2F, text #B71C1C. Moderate: fill #FFF8E1 stroke #F57C00, text #E65100. Lower: fill #E8F5E9 stroke #43A047, text #2E7D32. Body text #334155 (titles), #64748b (descriptions), #475569 (summaries), #94a3b8 (muted/separators). Zone opacity fills: #003459 opacity 0.03-0.08 for subtle background differentiation within sections."
