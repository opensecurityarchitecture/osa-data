  "supplemental_guidance": "All maintenance activities to include routine, scheduled maintenance and repairs are controlled; whether performed on site or remotely and whether the equipment is serviced on site or removed to another location. Organizational officials approve the removal of the information system or information system components from the facility when repairs are necessary. If the information system or component of the system requires off-site repair, the organization removes all information from associated media using approved procedures. After maintenance is performed on the information system, the organization checks all potentially impacted security controls to verify that the controls are still functioning properly.",
