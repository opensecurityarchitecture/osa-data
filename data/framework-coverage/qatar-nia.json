    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of the Qatar National Information Assurance (NIA) Policy v2.0, issued by Qatar's National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA). The NIA is mandatory for all Qatar government entities, semi-government organisations, and critical national infrastructure operators. The framework is modelled on ISO 27001/27002 and NIST 800-53 with a 3-tier classification system (Basic, Advanced, Critical). Qatar-specific requirements include NCSA compliance reporting obligations, Qatar national classification scheme alignment, data sovereignty and localisation mandates, and mandatory NCSA incident notification timelines. Incorporates new SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls where they genuinely improve coverage. Validate with NCSA-approved assessors for compliance/audit use."

      "rationale": "CP-01 contingency planning policy establishes the BCM framework. CP-02 contingency plan provides comprehensive continuity plans addressing all critical business functions. CP-03 contingency training ensures staff readiness for continuity scenarios. CP-04 contingency plan testing covers testing and exercising through tabletop exercises, functional tests, and full-scale exercises. CP-05 contingency plan update supports review and maintenance of plans based on test results and organisational changes. CP-06 alternate storage site and CP-07 alternate processing site address offsite recovery facilities. CP-08 telecommunications services covers resilient communications infrastructure. CP-09 system backup and CP-10 system recovery provide backup and restoration capabilities. CP-11 alternate communications protocols supports failover for communication channels. CP-12 (Rev 5) safe mode provides graceful degradation capability for critical systems, supporting NIA requirements for essential service continuity. CP-13 (Rev 5) alternative security mechanisms enables continued operations when primary security controls fail. PM-08 critical infrastructure plan integrates BCM with national critical infrastructure protection. PM-11 mission and business process definition identifies critical processes for business impact analysis. SI-13 (Rev 5) predictive maintenance enables proactive failure prevention, supporting NIA requirements for proactive continuity management.",
      "gaps": "Qatar NIA requires that business continuity plans for critical national infrastructure entities are aligned with Qatar's National Crisis Management Framework and coordinated with the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management. Business impact analysis must identify dependencies on Qatar national infrastructure (power, telecommunications, water). Continuity plans must ensure that Recovery Time Objectives for Critical tier systems do not exceed NCSA-mandated maximum outage windows. Continuity testing must include scenario exercises coordinated with Q-CERT for cyber-incident-triggered business disruption. Alternate processing sites for government systems must be located within Qatar unless explicitly approved by NCSA. SP 800-53 CP family provides strong business continuity coverage but Qatar-specific national crisis management integration, NCSA-mandated recovery objectives, and data sovereignty constraints on alternate sites are not addressed."
