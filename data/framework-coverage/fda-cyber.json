These guidance documents represent FDA's current thinking on medical device cybersecurity but are not legally binding regulations. SP 800-53 provides comprehensive security controls that address many FDA cybersecurity expectations but does not address medical device-specific concepts such as Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) requirements, patient safety risk analysis, total product lifecycle (TPLC) approach, or coordinated vulnerability disclosure for medical devices. Coverage reflects overlap between FDA cybersecurity expectations and SP 800-53 control families. Validate with qualified regulatory affairs professionals for FDA submission use."

      "gaps": "FDA's 'reasonable assurance' standard is a legal/regulatory threshold specific to device safety and effectiveness determinations. Evidence must demonstrate that cybersecurity risks have been adequately addressed such that the device's benefits outweigh its risks. SP 800-53 provides the technical control framework but the concept of 'reasonable assurance' as a regulatory evidentiary standard — where FDA reviewers evaluate whether the manufacturer's cybersecurity program is sufficient for device marketing authorisation — has no SP 800-53 equivalent. This is fundamentally a product regulatory determination, not an enterprise IT security assessment."
