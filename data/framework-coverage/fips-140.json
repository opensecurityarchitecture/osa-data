SP 800-53 addresses cryptographic protection policy (SC-12, SC-13) but not the detailed hardware/firmware validation, side-channel resistance testing, CAVP algorithm certification, and CMVP laboratory assessment processes that constitute the core of FIPS 140-3. Validate with CMVP-accredited testing laboratories for module certification use."
