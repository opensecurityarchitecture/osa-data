    "indications": "Easy to use but highly secure. Documents can be read on any un-trusted computer, it is assumed a Trojan Horse is present on the computer where the documents are read. Documents are also encrypted when downloaded to the USB stick. <br/><br/>",
    "contraIndications": "It is not an Ad-hoc solution, a USB stick is delivered to the users in the setup phase. The solution is practical only for a small number of users. <br/><br/>",
    "threatResistance": "The solution is resistance against generic Trojan Horse on the un-trusted computer where the Board of Directors read the documents. \"Board of Directors Room\" application is secured against any web application threats according to OWASP. A number of residual risks remain with this pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A board member taking screenshots and printing/mailing/saving the screenshots</li>\n<li>A board member handing the secure device to other persons</li>\n<li>A specific Trojan Horse attacking this specific device (USB stick with hardened browser)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>"
