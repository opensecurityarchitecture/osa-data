    "disclaimer": "Based on expert analysis of the SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF) v2024. SWIFT CSCF comprises 25 mandatory and 7 advisory controls for all SWIFT-connected institutions. Annual independent assessment attestation is required. Control applicability varies by architecture type (A1-A4, B). SWIFT CSCF aligns with ISO 27002:2022, NIST CSF v1.1, PCI DSS 4.0, and SOC 2 TSC. SWIFT-specific requirements around messaging interface security, transaction business controls, RMA management, and SWIFT-proprietary software integrity have limited SP 800-53 equivalence. Validate with qualified SWIFT CSP assessors for attestation use."
